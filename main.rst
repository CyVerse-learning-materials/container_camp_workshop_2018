Container Camp Workshop
------------------------

**Workshop Code of Conduct**
============================

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our workshop are required 
to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code 
throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to 
help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. 

This Code of Conduct taken from 
http://confcodeofconduct.com/. See http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq
for more information on codes of conduct.

**FAIR principles**
===================

Container camp supports FAIR data principles by providing services that help make data 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Participants will get an introduction 
to containers and learn how to create and manage containers.

**Learning objectives**
=======================

Participants will learn key containerization concepts for developing 
reproducible analysis pipelines, with emphasis on container lifecycle 
management from design, execution and scaling. 

The workshop will cover key concepts containers such as defining the 
architecture of Containers, building Docker images and pushing them to 
public and private repositories as well as we will show how to scale your 
analysis from laptop to cloud and to HPC systems using containers. 

**Who Should Attend**
=====================

Faculty, Postdocs, graduate students who use and analyze data of all
types (genomics, image data, from animals, plants, etc.).

**Workshop Level**
==================

This workshop focused on beginning users with little to no previous container
experience.

Intermeidate and advanced users attend to better understand container capabilities 
and resources, including deploying their own tools and extending these analyses 
into Cloud and HPC.

**Need Help?**
==============

You can reach the lead instructor, Upendra Devisetty, at upendra @ cyverse dot org. 
You can also talk to any of the instructors or TAs if you need immediate help, 
or (in an emergency) call 911.


**Pre-Workshop Setup**
======================

These are the minimum Setup Instructions for the Container camp workshop at CyVerse, 
University of Arizona, which will run from March 7th to March 9th, 2017.

**About CyVerse**
=================

**CyVerse Vision:** Transforming science through data-driven discovery.

**CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national
cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in
its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
educational agenda.

Workshop Topics
----------------
These are the topics for the Container camp workshop at CyVerse, University of Arizona, which will run from March 7th to March 9th, 2017.


**Training session in Docker**
===============================

**Trainers (Upendra Devisetty and Kapeel Chougule)**    

This would be the introductory session for concept of Docker. In this session we explain the various aspects of the Docker Containers. Starting with the basics of Docker which focuses on the installation and configuration of Docker, it gradually moves on to advanced topics such as managing data using volumes and Registries. Overall this session cover the development aspects of Docker and how you can get up and running on the development environments using Docker Containers

- `Docker basics/Introduction (Kapeel) <dockerintro.html>`_

- `Advanced docker (Upendra) <dockeradvanced.html>`_


**Training session in Singularity**
===================================

**Trainers (Tyson Swetnam and John Fonner)**    

This would be the introductory session for concept of Singularity. In this part we will 
show you how to containerize your software/applications using Singularity, push them to 
Singularityhub and deploy them on cloud and HPC.

- `Singularity basics/Introduction (Tyson Swetnam) <singularityintro.html>`_

- `Advanced Singularity (John Fonner) <singularityadvanced.html>`_


**Training session in scaling up your analysis using containers**
====================================================================

**Trainer (Tyson Swetnam)**  

This would be the final session of the workshop where we will show you how 
to scale your analyses (simple apps and complex workflow) from Laptop to Cloud to 
HPC and also show how using several compute clusters can scale your analysis significantly.

- `Introduction to Container scaling (Mats Rynge/Tyson Swetnam) <containerscaling.html>`_

**Training session in Biocontainers**
=====================================

**Trainer (Upendra Devisetty)**

This would be the introductory session for concept of Biocontainers. In this session 
we will show you how to containerize your bioinformatic software/applications 
(with special focus in Proteomics, Genomics, Transcriptomics and Metabolomics), push 
them to Dockerhub and other registries and finally deploy them on cloud.
