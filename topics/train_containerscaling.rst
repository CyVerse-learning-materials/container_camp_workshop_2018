**Training session in scaling up your analysis using containers**
====================================================================

**Trainer (Tyson Swetnam)**  

This would be the final session of the workshop where we will show you how 
to scale your analyses (simple apps and complex workflow) from Laptop to Cloud to 
HPC and also show how using several compute clusters can scale your analysis significantly.
