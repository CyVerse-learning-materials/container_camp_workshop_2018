**Training session in scaling up your analysis using containers**
====================================================================

**Trainers (Mats Rynge, Nicholas Hazekamp and Kyle Sweeney)**  

In this exciting session of the workshop we will show you how to scale your analyses (simple apps and complex workflow) using `Docker swarm <https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/>`_, `Google Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_ and Workflows Management Systems such as `Pegasus <https://pegasus.isi.edu/>`_, `Work-Queue <https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/>`_ and `Makeflow <https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/makeflow/>`_ from Laptop to Cloud to HPC resources such as Stampede2, OSG and campus clusters and also show how using several compute clusters can scale your analysis significantly and efficiently. So of the topics include

- `OSG (Open Science Grid) Singularity Infrastructure <../container_scaling/containerscaling_osg.html>`_ (Mats Rynge)

- `Pegasus Workflows with Application Containers <../container_scaling/containerscaling_pegasus.html>`_ (Mats Rynge)

- `Distributed computing with containers <../container_scaling/containerscaling_dc.html>`_ (Nicholas and Kyle **remotely**)
