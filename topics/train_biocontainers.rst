Training session in Biocontainers
---------------------------------

**Trainers (Upendra Devisetty and John Fonner)**

This would be the introductory session for concept of Biocontainers. In this session 
we will show you how to containerize your bioinformatic software/applications 
(with special focus in Proteomics, Genomics, Transcriptomics and Metabolomics), push 
them to Dockerhub and other registries and finally deploy them on cloud.
